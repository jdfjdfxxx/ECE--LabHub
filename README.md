# ECE-LabHub

Collection of electronics, signal processing, and microcontroller projects


## What's inside?

- Analog & digital circuit design → **Multisim**
- DSP experiments, filters, FFT → **MATLAB**
- MCU projects, peripherals, protocols → **Keil μVision 5**
- Small communication & embedded systems

Most projects include code + simulation + waveform + short notes.

These are just records of my university coursework and small personal projects in Electronic Information Engineering.  

Feel free to use, modify, or learn from any of the code/schematics/solutions **for free** (no attribution required, but appreciated!).
